Carpet Purchase and Installation Estimator:
You are given the price of carpet per square yard: For example: $40.00
You are given that each square yard of carpetpurchased has an installation cost of $15.00
You are given an ArrayList of size X that contains the length and width dimensions of one or more rooms in inches – for example:
ArrayList[0] = {length: 120, width: 96}   for example: 120 X 96 ==> 11,520 square inches.
ArrayList[1] = {length: 96, width: 82}
….
For reference: Square yard of carpet is 36 X 36 inches = 1,296 sqre inches.
 
Calculate the cost for Carpet Installation, using the following process:
For each room round up to the next square yard indicated by its size and then add 10% to that room’s total to account for construction waste.
(area (around) + 110%)  
With this 110% figure then round up to the next square yard.   (as carpet is sold only by the square yard).
Add up the total carpet needs for each room.   
Your output should contain 3 final values to present to the customer:
Total square yards needed for whole project:
Total Carpet cost.
Total Installation cost.
TOTAL COST OF EVERYTHING: $
